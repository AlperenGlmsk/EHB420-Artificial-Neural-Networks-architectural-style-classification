# Architectural Style Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks

This project focuses on **classifying architectural styles** from images using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** in MATLAB.  
The dataset consists of **25 distinct architectural styles**, each represented by a set of labeled images.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

1. **Dataset**
   - Contains images grouped into 25 folders, each representing a unique architectural style.
   - Each image is preprocessed for resizing, normalization, and augmentation before training.

2. **Model**
   - Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented using MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox.
   - Input: Flattened image features.
   - Output: One-hot encoded vector representing architectural style.

3. **Methodology**
   - Data loading & preprocessing.
   - Feature extraction (resizing, normalization).
   - ANN training and hyperparameter tuning.
   - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

4. **Key Features**
   - Fully implemented in MATLAB.
   - Easy to modify for different numbers of architectural styles.
   - Supports dataset augmentation for improved generalization.
